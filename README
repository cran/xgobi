Note that this R package is just an interface
	R <--> xgobi
	R <--> xgvis
to the two (related) programs xgobi and xgvis.
These standalone programs are no longer developed,
while their authors rather focus on the more flexible and modern
`GGobi' and its tools, see  http://www.ggobi.org/
with its own R package	    --------------------- Rggobi.

You must install these independently and can get them via

or the Windows port as described in the file INSTALL.windows (in the
inst directory in the sources).
